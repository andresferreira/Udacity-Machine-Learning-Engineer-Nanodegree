    "- Investment firms, hedge funds, and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. A wealth of information is available in the form of historical stock prices and company performance data, suitable for machine learning algorithms to process.\n",
    "- For this project, the task is to build a stock price predictor that takes daily trading data over a certain date range as input, and outputs projected estimates for given query dates. Note that the inputs will contain multiple metrics, such as opening price (Open), highest price the stock traded at (High), how many stocks were traded (Volume) and closing price adjusted for stock splits and dividends (Adjusted Close); the system only needs to predict the Adjusted Close price.\n",

    "- ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (Alternative name: Box-Jenkins Model)\n",
    "- ARIMA is a forecasting technique that projects the future values of a series based on its own inertia\n",
    "- Its main application is short-term forecasting requiring at least 40 historical data points\n",
    "- ARIMA works best when data: \n",
    "    + Exhibits a stable or consistent pattern\n",
    "    + Have a minimum amount of outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models parameter\n",
    "- ARIMA attempts to describe the movement in a stationary time series as a function of \"autoregressive and moving avg\"\n",

    "    + MA(moving avg)\n",
    "- Autoregressive Models: \n",

    "    + X(t): the time-series\n",
    "    + X(t-n):  time series lagged n\n",
    "    + A(n): autoregressive parameters\n",
    "    + E(t): the error term of the model\n",
    "- Moving Average Models:\n",
    "    $$X(t) = -B(1) * E(t-1) + E(t)$$\n",

    "#### Approach\n",

    "    + d: degree of differencing\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Why ARIMA ?\n",
    "- ARIMA is a specific model for time-series analysis, I choose it to compare its performance versus the linear regression model\n",
    "- ARIMA has been proven that has a reliable accuracy, robustness over time-series prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmark\n",
    "- The Linear Regression model will be compared with the ARIMA model\n",
    "- Some Hypotheses I imply from Exploratory Visualization and Analysis:\n",
    "    + Since AAPL time series data are strongly correlated, we can use more lagged values as input features thus the lagged order of ARIMA model would be set high\n",
    "    + Otherwise, XOM time series are not strongly correlated, the lagged order would be lower for this series.\n",
    "    + Though heavily affected by trend and fluctuation the ARIMA model tend to be less accurate in predicting AAPL and more accurate in predicting XOM series which is less affected by trend component and more stable\n",

    "    - Lagged values:\n",

    "        + How lagged features are created\n",
    "            ```python\n",
    "            while n < lagged_order:\n",
    "                shift the series 1 step and add a new feature as x(t-n)\n",
    "            Remove the empty entries of dataframe created by shifting\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "    - Examine correlation between lagged datapoints\n",
    "        + Since my hypothesis is that we can predict the current in the series based on historical data, it is needed to check if the current value and previous values have a strong correlation.\n",
    "        + A strong correlation indicates that our linear regression model has prediction lower errors\n",

    "- The ARIMA model accuracy is low which is interestingly unpredictable\n",
    "- The time required for training ARIMA model is high(~12 hrs for grid searching optimization)\n",
    "- My hypothesis is that the ARIMA model is better than the Linear Regression model if there are no trend but the Linear Regression model seem to be strong enough to predict this nonconventional data\n",
